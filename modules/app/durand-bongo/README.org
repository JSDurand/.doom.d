* Description
# A summary of what this module does.

This module configures and tunes the package =bongo= to my preferences. It is heavily
inspired and influenced by Protesilaos' configurations. It is highly recommended to have a
look at his configurations, which are well documented and explained.

+ If possible, include a brief list of feature highlights here
+ Like code completion, syntax checking or available snippets
+ Include links to packages & external things where possible

** Maintainers
+ @JSDurand (Author)

** Module Flags
This module provides no flags.

** Plugins
+ [[https://github.com/dbrock/bongo][bongo]]

** Hacks
+ I added a function to use ivy to select the songs to add to bongo playlist buffer.
+ I define an overriding advice so that ~bongo-dired-line~ goes to
  ~bongo-default-directory~ when no track is under point. This provides a simple way to
  jump to the music directory from within =bongo=.

* Prerequisites
This module has requires =mpv= to play music. For MacOS users, simply install =mpv= by

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew install mpv
#+END_SRC

* Features
I modified some key-bindings and added some functions.

* Configuration
It is not advised to use this module directly since it is highly entangled with my own
other settings in doom emacs. So it is not recommended to /confifure/ this module unless
you know what you are doing, in which case it is not necessary for me to tell you how to
configure this module. :P

* Troubleshooting
Just fire an issue if there are any issues.
