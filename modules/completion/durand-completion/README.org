* Description
This is my completion framework using mainly the built-in tools such as =icomplete=. Also
uses the package =orderless= for better matching, and uses the package =embark= for more
actions on candidates, and of course the package =icomplete-vertical= for a visually
appealing interface.

- Supports multiple selection out of the box using =completing-read-multiple=.
- Supports /headlong/ effect using a custom hook function.
- Supports actions on completion candidates, by means of the package =embark=.
- A custom function for more feature-rich selection from lists.
