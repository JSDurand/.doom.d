** Module Flags
This module provides no flags.

* Prerequisites
This module has no prerequisites.

* Features
This configures gnus and gives it some sane defaults. But the main settings are not here:
they are put in =~/.gnus= so that gnus will re-load them each time they are changed.

Since I value the ability to center the screen, I bound the keys =zt=, =zz=, and =zb= to
recenter to the top, middle, and the bottom of the screen, respectively.
