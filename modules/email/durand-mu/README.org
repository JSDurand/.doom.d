* Description
My settings of mu4e, the email client for emacs that I found the easiest to set up.

** Maintainers
+ @JSDurand (Author)

** Module Flags
This module provides no flags.

** Hacks
- ~mu4e-contacts-show-time~ is modified to print more friendly messages.

* Prerequisites
This module has no prerequisites.

* Features
+ This requires user confirmation before sending emails, since I sometimes accidentally
  press =C-c C-c= while I did not mean to send the mail...
+ doom removes the mark =D= for deleting mails, but I really need tha mark, so I added
  that back.
+ doom switches to =org-msg=, but I don't like that package, since it does not respect
  mu4e contexts, so I stole the old doom configs and put in this module, in order to
  continue using =org-mu4e=.
