* Description
This module grows out of my personal configurations of emacs back when I was not using
doom emacs. The purpose of it is to have an *ideal* emacs of my own.

After I started using doom emacs, a lot of the functionalities of this module were
transferred to other modules, so all that remains is a bunch of custom functions that I am
too lazy to find suitable places for.

** Maintainers
+ @JSDurand (Author)

** Module Flags
This module provides no flags.

* Prerequisites
This module has no prerequisites.

* Features
The most prominent feature of this module is that it provides a lot of custom functions.
For example, there is a function to open the browser for me.

In the future when I have some more leisure time, I will try to document these functions
better. But I will leave them for now. :p
